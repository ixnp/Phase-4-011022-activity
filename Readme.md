        gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'

      <img src="assets/password_digest.png" alt="password digest" style="margin-right: 10px;" />

 4. Add has_secure_password to users and add the password param to the users strong params in the users controller. Why is this password instead of password_digest? Test your user create route to prove your hashing is working.
