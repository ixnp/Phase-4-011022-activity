# Deliverables
1. Implement classes for SinglyLinkedLists and Nodes. You can do this in ruby or js in one of the LinkedList files provided. 
>Note: If you are using ruby don't forget your attr_accessor

2. Create a method on the Linked List class that appends a new node to the end of the list. 

```
# [c] -next-> nil
# head -> [a] -next-> [b] -next-> nil 

Expected output 
# head -> [a] -next-> [b] -next-> [c] -next-> nil
```

3. You can add this print method to your class to test your append method.

```
def print
       current = @head

       while current
           puts current.value
           current = current.next
       end
end


```
